## Deployment

The following are provided for ease of deployment:

1. Docker ready (Dockerfile, docker compose)
2. Fixtures.
   - This can be regenerated by running `python scripts/generate_fixtures.py`. Feel free to change the parameters in the file (i.e number of rides, users, etc)

This app also only uses sqlite for development purposes only. If needed, feel free to add another service in docker compose for database. Take note that the django app itself it not configured to connect to an external database.

The default debug server of Django is used for both docker and native deployments.

### Prerequisites

1. Python >= 3.12
2. Create a `.env` file. This can be used in both Docker and Native deployment.
   - `DEBUG`
     - As per django docs, set this to `True` to provide detailed tracebacks and env info during development.
     - Set this to `True` to enable [**Django Debug Toolbar**](https://django-debug-toolbar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
   - `LOG_LEVEL`
     - Level of logs to be displayed.
     - Choices: `[DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR]`
   - `PORT`
     - The port to be exposed / deployed.


### Docker

1. Run `docker compose up` / `docker compose up -d` to automatically build and run the app. The dockerfile is configured such that it automatically migrates and runs the app after the container is up. If the file `fixtures.json` is present, then it would automatically be loaded upon container startup.
2. Even though this is just a developer test, for proper security practice, manually create a superuser for an admin account.

    ```sh
    docker compose exec backend python manage.py createsuperuser 
    ```

    You will be asked to enter the ff details: username, email address, phone number, role *(admin, driver, rider)*, and password.

### Native

1. Setup your python environment, refer to `Developers > Developer environment` section below.
2. Run `./start.sh/`. Similar to the Docker route, this will automatically migrate, load fixtures, and run the server with the default port (8000).

## Developers

### Development environment

1. Create and activate a virtual environment of a supported python version with your tool of choice (e.g pyenv, virtualenv).
2. Install the project dependencies:

    ```sh
    make install-dev
    ```

### Updating requirements

1. If needed, add new optional dependency group/s in `pyproject.toml` (e.g. `optional-dependencies.{group}`)
2. Update/introduce dependencies in `requirements/{group}.in`.
3. Generate new pinned requirements files:

    ```sh
    make update-reqs
    ```

4. Sync dependencies:

    ```sh
    make install-dev
    ```

5. Commit changes.
